# simple-rag-qa
This repository provides a minimal yet effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for document retrieval and question answering. It integrates a pre-trained embedding model to encode documents, a lightweight vector database for efficient similarity search, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate context-aware responses.
